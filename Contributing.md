# Contributing
Steps on how to contribute!

## Adding a website
To add a website, please use this sample code
```<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Secret Rick Roll</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Make rick rolls disgused as news articles!</p>
    <button class="btn btn-primary css-button-shadow-border-sliding--sky"
    onclick="location.href=('https://www.secretrickroll.com/')">Make one!</button>
  </div>
</div>
```
This makes sure that your cards are fluent with the rest. Also, make sure to put it under a appropiate catagory! I have notes in the code showing where they are for refrence.
